          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Game Idea Generators was born from the frustration of staring at a blank screen, 
            knowing you want to create something amazing but not knowing where to start. 
            We've all been there - whether it's 2 AM during a game jam or the beginning of 
            a new project when the possibilities feel both infinite and overwhelming.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool doesn't replace your creativity - it amplifies it. Each generated idea 
            is a seed that you can grow into something uniquely yours. Sometimes the best 
            ideas come from unexpected combinations, and that's exactly what we specialize in.
