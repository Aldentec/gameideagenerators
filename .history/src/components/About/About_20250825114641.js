            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
            Look, we've all been there. You're sitting there with a blank Unity project or a fresh 
            Godot scene, and your brain just... nopes out. Maybe it's 3 AM during Ludum Dare, 
            maybe it's day one of your next big indie project. Either way, you know you want to 
            build something cool, but the ideas just aren't flowing.
            </p>
            <p>
            That's where we come in. This isn't some magic creativity machine that's going to 
            design your game for you - that's still your job (and honestly, that's the fun part). 
            Think of these generators more like that friend who throws out random "what if" 
            scenarios until something clicks. Sometimes the weirdest combinations end up being 
            pure gold.
